# Time Slicer 0.1

A graphical tool for creating Timeslice images from timelapses.

- Should work on Windows, Linux, Mac etc. but you need to compile it by yourself.
- Linear transition with rotation and scaling
- Radial transition (To be coded)
- Image preview for parameter tuning
- Threaded calculations
- Drag'n'drop image adding


Most of the features are still under development and the project is more like a one day/weekend project.
The software was created just to have something to compete against commercial tools and Photoshop scripts and to stich together my sunset timelapse.
The software can/will be developed further if there's demand for this kind of program.
